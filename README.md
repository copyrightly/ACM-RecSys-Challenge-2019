# ACM-RecSys-Challenge-2019-
The goal of this challenge is to develop a session-based and context-aware recommender system using various input data to provide a list of accommodations that will match the needs of the user.

In the challenge, participants will be tasked with predicting which accommodations (items) have been clicked in the search result during the last part of a user session in an offline evaluation setup.
